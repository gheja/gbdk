 *
 *	aslex.c contains the following functions:
 *		char	endline()
 *		char	get()
 *		VOID	getid(id,c)
 *		__ssize_t	getline()
 *		int	getmap()
 *		char	getnb()
 *		VOID	getst()
 *		int	more()

 *
 *	aslex.c contains no local/static variables

 *					maximum length NCPS
 *		int	c		mode flag
 *					>=0	this is first character to
 *						copy to the string buffer
 *					<0	skip white space, first
 *						character must be a LETTER
 *
 *	The function getid() scans the current assembler-source text line
 *	from the current position copying the next LETTER | DIGIT string
 *	into the external string buffer (id).  The string ends when a non
 *	LETTER or DIGIT character is found. The maximum number of
 *	characters copied is NCPS.  If the input string is larger than
 *	NCPS characters then the string is truncated, if the input string
 *	is shorter than NCPS characters then the string is NULL filled.
 *	If the mode argument (c) is >=0 then (c) is the first character
 *	copied to the string buffer, if (c) is <0 then intervening white
 *	space (SPACES and TABS) are skipped and the first character found
 *	must be a LETTER else a 'q' error terminates the parse of this
 *	assembler-source text line.
 *
